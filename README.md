# cool-trinkets
a repo of cool things useful to game devs using godot 4+

Hi! looking for free stuff to use in your games? Here ya go! Also, if you need help with literally anything, msg me one way or another. issues works. dicord is spike_us.
this repo is meant to be useful, so if you dont understand something or something is broken, LET ME KNOW. I will never get mad at anyone for pointing out broken stuff. That
said, I am NOT a free programmer for you. i WILL NOT make new stuff on request of you, unless i feel it is really good. feel free to post requests in the github, or dm me on discord if you have
requests. have fun, everything is public domain. but you have to keep it that way. but ofc, you can sell a game project that incorporated my stuff in it. just cant be the main thing.
again, post or msg if you have questions. get coding!

All of the following images were made with assets from this repo. Excluding the trees and the post proccessing. Shaders do have a lot of configuration though, but nothing you can't do!
